# GDash Deployments

This document details the best-practices on deploying the GDash gateway for development, staging and production use.

## Overview

During normal software development lifecycles, a codebase will go through at least three basic stages:
- Local Development
- Staging (Quality Assurance & User Acceptance Testing)
- Production (Real World System Usage)

In the case of a bugs or pressing issues there can be two additional stages:
- Debugging (for bugs that are non-critical in the codebase, usually feed back into Local Development)
- Hot-Patches (for bugs that require high-priority resolution, usually on production systems an doutside the scope of normal workflows)

Each stage has different requirements and use cases. The subsequent sections of this document will detail each of these stages.
